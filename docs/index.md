=== "FAQ"
    ### FAQ
    ??? question "Where can I download the the game?"
        I provide patch (.bps) files, that you can apply to your own leagally obtained copy of FireRed. You can download the latest patch on my [Pokecommunity post](https://www.pokecommunity.com/threads/update-new-music-sword-and-shield-ultimate-plus-gba-english-version-complete-1-1-4.526384/) or on my [discord server](https://discord.gg/haWvnjYjkb).

    ??? question "How does patching a ROM work?"
        Patching a ROM is sort of like adding a mod to a base game. You can use [ROM Patcher JS](https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/legacy/) to patch your ROM on any device. If you need a comprehensive tutorial, there is one availible on my [discord server](https://discord.gg/DdH7gjTNGx).

    ??? question "What can I play this game on?"
        This GBA game will run on any emulator (besides web based emulators like Eclipse). This includes Linux based handheld emulation devices like the RG35XX models. It also works on openFPGA and on real hardware using EZ Flash/Everdrive or any other flashable cartridge (cartridge permitting). It also works on 3DS ([Making a .cia file tutorial](https://discord.gg/FWXfPPzdVR)). I've even got this running on my PS Vita. R4 carts and gbarunner on dsi seem to have issues though. 

    ??? question "Are there nature mints/ability capsules in this game?"
        No to mints and... sort of. Once you catch a mon, you cannot alter its nature or ability. However, you can use the ability pill item to force your next encountered mon to have its hidden ability. You can also hunt for abilities with the DexNav.
    
    ??? question "How do I use the Wyndon gift codes?"
        There is a gift object in the Wyndon Pokecenter. Interact with it to enter the codes. Codes can be found in the "Mystery Gifts" tab.

    ??? question "What are shiny odds? Is there a shiny charm? How can I shiny hunt?"
        Base odds are 1/8192, shiny charm should drop it to 1/4096. The best way to shiny hunt is to use the DexNav. It gives the best odds when paired with the shiny charm.

    ??? question "How do I use the DexNav and how does it work?"
        Press the start menu, and hit right on the Dpad to access the Dexnav. It works following [this](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/DexNav#Shiny_probability) guide.

    ??? question "What generations of Pokemon are in the game"
        Generation 1-8 are included in the game, as well as Hisuian Typhlosion, Hisuian Samurott, Hisuian Decidueye, Dipplin, Hydrapple, and Archeludon. If you notice any mons that may not have a spawn, please let me know and I can find a place to add them.

    ??? question "Can I get a hidden ability starter?"
        Yes, if you use the [Casual Patch](https://discord.gg/DPTppTUGC8), you will get an ability pill before you get your starter. Be sure to use it before you choose your starter and you should get a hidden ability starter. If you'd like to do this without the casual patch, you can also soft reset before talking to your mom, eventually she will give you the ability pills.

    ??? question "Do Shiny Charms stack?"
        No.

    ??? question "How do trade evolutions work?"
        There is a Link Cable item that can be used like an evolution stone to evolve pokemon that normally evolve via trade.

    ??? question "Where can I get evolution items?"
        Most evolution items can be bought from an NPC who is standing in sight as you enter Wild Area 3 South. If you need help finding Wild Area 3, consult the Wild Area map!

    ??? question "I'm stuck, where do I go?"
        The story is very faithful to the SwSh switch game, if you ever find yourself stuck. Most times a walk through of the switch game will help you find where you need to go.

    ??? question "How do I use dynamax, mega evo, Z moves?"
        Press Start or R in battle on the move you would like to use. Dynamax can only be used in certain battles. You will need the Mega-Ring to mega evolve and the Z-Ring to use Z moves which can be received from side quests.

    ??? question "The scientist took my galar fossil, but didn't revive it.. what gives?"
        The scientist will collect the fossils and give you all four galar fossil mons after she has recieved the 4th fossil.

    ??? question "How do I update to the newest version of the game from an older version?"
        Updating ROM hacks is a bit different than something like a switch game. I can't just push an update to your device. What actually happens when you "update" is downloading the latest patch, patching to a clean copy of FireRed, then bringing your in game save file over to the new ROM. For patching a new version, just follow the [patching tutorial](https://discord.gg/DdH7gjTNGx).

        Transferring your save varies greatly by device/emulator. First thing you need to do is ensure that you put down an in game save. Most times, you will have a save file with the same exact name as the version of the ROM you have been playing. If the game was called "SWSH Ultimate 3.1.5.gba", you would have a save file called "SWSH Ultimate 3.1.5.sav". That .sav file is your in game save. If you copy that file and rename the save copy to the name of the version you are updating to, let's say "SWSH Ultimate Plus 1.1.4.gba", you would name the file "SWSH Ultimate Plus 1.1.4.sav".

    ??? question "Can this game be randomized?"
        Sort of! There is now a Pseudo-Randomization option. Access it by interacting with the notice at the top of the stairs in your bedroom! 

    ??? question "Are there any known bugs?"
        Yes. 
        Running Up and Down in the pokecenter (front to back) will cause a memory issue, which makes it so talking to Nurse Joy or the PC freezes the game. If you do this, please exit the pokecenter and all will be ok!
     
        The Fly Map doesn't work/is messed up in certain areas.
     
        On some emulators, some text boxes may be invisible or missing (Marnie after beating piers, just mash A).
     
        After beating Opal, the event in Hammerlocke may cause a crash, please put down an in game save after beating Opal. I think i have resolved this in the latest update, but better safe than sorry.
     
        Changing the Button Mode in game option to anything but "help" will cause the menu to be slow. Please leave it set to "help".
